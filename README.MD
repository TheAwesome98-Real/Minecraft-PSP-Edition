# Minecraft: PlayStation® Portable Edition
We are working on making a realistic homebrew of Minecraft. What we mean by this, is it is like PlayStation® 3 Edition, but for the PSP.
## Playing
Go into ```builds```, and take out the latest release you can see in there. The folder should be labeled ```MINECRAFT_PSP``` and it should have ```EBOOT.PBP``` in it. Put your PSP into USB mode, put the ```MINECRAFT_PSP``` folder in your PSP in the folder ```(path to your psp)/PSP/GAME```, and then come out of USB mode, go to the Game section in the XMB (Xross Media Bar), and then go to Memory Card. From there, choose Minecraft: PlayStation® Portable Edition, and it should begin the game. You should not need to do anything to the game other than put it in this folder. If you have any issues, please submit an Issue in the Issues tab.
## Building
